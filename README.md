# Collaballage

_Good things get created through collaboration_

Looking to collaborate with peers to create collage art? Welcome to `Collabalage`!

## Setup

* Run the following commands:

```
fork to your github account
git clone collabalage https://github.com/Team-Lilith/capstone.git
```

## Customize

Now that you've got the code, follow these steps to get acclimated:

* `npm install`

## Start

Running `npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or `webpack` separately, you can also
`npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

From there, just follow your bliss.

### Heroku

For a demo, visit our deployed version:

* `https://collaballage.herokuapp.com/`

### Cody's own deploy script

Your local copy of the application can be pushed up to Heroku at will,
using our deployment script:

1.  Make sure that all your work is fully committed and merged into your
    master branch on Github.
2.  If you currently have an existing branch called "deploy", delete
    it now (`git branch -d deploy`). We will use a dummy branch
    with the name `deploy` (see below), so and the script below will error if a
    branch with that name already exists.
3.  `npm run deploy`
    _ this will cause the following commands to happen in order:
    _ `git checkout -b deploy`: checks out a new branch called
    `deploy`. Note that the name `deploy` here is not magical, but it needs
    to match the name of the branch we specify when we push to our `heroku`
    remote.
    _ `webpack -p`: webpack will run in "production mode"
    _ `git add -f public/bundle.js public/bundle.js.map`: "force" add
    these files which are listed in `.gitignore`.
    _ `git commit --allow-empty -m 'Deploying'`: create a commit, even
    if nothing changed
    _ `git push --force heroku deploy:master`: push your local
    `deploy` branch to the `master` branch on `heroku`
    _ `git checkout master`: return to your master branch
    _ `git branch -D deploy`: remove the deploy branch

Now, you should be deployed!

Why do all of these steps? The big reason is because we don't want our
production server to be cluttered up with dev dependencies like
`webpack`, but at the same time we don't want our development
git-tracking to be cluttered with production build files like
`bundle.js`! By doing these steps, we make sure our development and
production environments both stay nice and clean.

* Happy Collaballaging!
